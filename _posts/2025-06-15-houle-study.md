The study by **Houle et al. (2011)** examined the impact of a **community-based physical activity intervention** designed for **low-income and immigrant women** in Montréal, Canada. 
This randomized controlled trial aimed to improve participants’ **moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)** through a 12-week program that combined **in-person exercise sessions** and **health empowerment workshops**.

In the **intervention group**, women participated in weekly **60–90 minute sessions** that included activities like **Zumba, walking, and dance**, alongside group workshops on **nutrition and body image**. 
These were held in local community centers and led by **community health workers**, ensuring a culturally sensitive and accessible delivery.

The study included **108 participants**, of whom **70% were born outside Canada** and **75% lived below the poverty line**. Physical activity was assessed using a validated questionnaire before and after the program. 
Participants in the **intervention group** increased their MVPA from **36 to 129 minutes per week**, while those in the **control group** improved from **25 to 73 minutes**. The **between-group difference was 44.6 minutes**, a **statistically significant** improvement (*p = 0.009*).

**Strengths** of the study include high retention (85%), community-based delivery, and real-world applicability. **Limitations** include reliance on self-reported PA, lack of follow-up, and absence of objective tracking tools.

> The findings suggest that non-digital, community-embedded programs can effectively increase physical activity in low-SES populations. Future interventions—digital or otherwise—should draw on these principles of accessibility, cultural tailoring, and social support to promote equitable health outcomes.
