<p>In this meta-analysis, Western et al. examine the effectiveness of digital interventions that aim to increase physical activity in individuals of low socioeconomic status compared to those of high socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status is used to explain an individual's level of prosperity or social standing, citing factors including wealth, educational level, and occupation (Baker 2014). The authors want to figure out whether digital technologies such as wearables, mobile apps, and other web-based tools can provide equal benefits across <b>different socioeconomic groups</b>. They also investigate whether the number or type of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) used in these interventions have a further impact on their effectiveness. The meta-analysis included <b>19</b> randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1990 and 2020, incorporating 20 interventions and a total of <b>5419</b> participants. These studies were chosen using the PRISMA guidelines for screening and selection, and were taken from databases like MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, and the meta-analysis used random-effects models in order to take heterogeneity into consideration.</p>

<p>Data was extracted on physical activity outcomes (via self-reporting or measured by devices) and socioeconomic status indicators such as income and deprivation indices. Socioeconomic status was then dichotomized into low and high with the help of study-specific thresholds (i.e., median income, education level). As mentioned previously, <b>random-effects models</b> were the primary method and were used to pool the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in physical activity between intervention and control groups. <b>IÂ²</b> statistics were also calculated to account for heterogeneity, and <b>subgroup analyses</b> were conducted by intervention type (physical activity only vs. multi-behaviour), country, chronic disease status, and intervention duration. A <b>meta-regression</b> was performed to test associations between the amount of BCTs and intervention effects. <b>Publication bias</b> was also evaluated using funnel plots and the Egger's test, in addition to the use of the <b>Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2)</b>, which assesses the quality of the studies.</p>
