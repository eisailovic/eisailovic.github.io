<p>Physical activity is known to provide several health benefits, from improving overall fitness and cardiovascular health to reducing risks of developing possible diseases. Although there have been more and more attempts to encourage physical activity in past two decades, the prevalence of physical inacivity has increased from 32% to 37% between 2001 and 2016 in high-income countries and has stayed twice as high as that in low-income countries (Guthold et al. 2018). In this meta-analysis, Western et al. investigate the effectiveness of emerging digital technologies that seek to promote increased physical activity, particularly with individuals of low socioeconomic status. Such technologies include:
<ul>
<li><b>Wearable activity trackers:</b> smart watches, pedometers, and acceleromeeters that include features that count steps, monitor heart rate, and offer overall real-time feedback</li>
<li><b>Mobile apps:</b> e.g., custom-designed for setting goals, providing educational content, or self-monitoring, and can offer interactive tracking of physical activity, personal feedback, as well as push notifications</li>
<li><b>Web-based platforms:</b> can present advice regarding physical activity as well as function as online dashboards and virtual coaching, and similarly to mobile apps, can supply educational modules, community support, and tracking of personal progress</li>
<li><b>Text messaging (SMS) and E-mail:</b> much like push notifications provided by mobile apps, one can receive automated reminders, prompts, encouraging messages, etc. This method of digital intervention may aid in reinforcing goals without much high-tech engagement</li>
<li><b>Hybrid interventions:</b> these may include a combination of digital tools and interpersonal support (e.g., in-person coaching and counseling, consultations with medical professionals)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The digital interventions that are mentioned in the meta-analysis frequently involved certain Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs). One of these are <b>self-monitoring</b>, which appears in most of the studies that were included in this meta-analysis. Within the context of psychology, it is known as the ability to manage and regulate one's own behaviour, and can in this area be applied by tracking progress via apps or wearables, for example. <b>Goal-setting</b> and <b>feedback</b> were also among common BCTs, and can be exemplified by personalized physical activity targets and encouraging progress reports. Other BCTs included <b>action planning</b> and <b>social support</b>. Action planning can involve the use of specific strategies to increase physical activity, for instance a prompt that motivates a user to walk for ten minutes after a meal. Under social support, one might consider certain community features or peer comparisons.</p>

<p>Some argue that the presence of digital health tools can create a “divide” in accessibility, often speculating that implementations such as wearables, apps, and web platforms are typically designed with individuals of a higher socioeconomic status in mind that may also exhibit a higher <b>eHealth literacy</b> (the ability to look for, understand, critically evaluate, and apply digital health information) (Machert et al. 2016). Lower socioeconomic status groups seemingly tend to lack this literacy, which can in turn limit engagement and reaping possible benefits from these types of interventions (Guo et al. 2021).</p>

<p>While the aforementioned types of digital interventions have displayed some potential for encouraging more physical activity (Jahangiry et al. 2017), there is little current research that examines the effect of these on communities of lower socioeconomic status. Western et al. thus seeks to close this gap.</p>
