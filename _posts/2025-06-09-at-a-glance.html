<h2>Focus of the study:</h2>

<p>The focus of this meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of digital interventions (e.g., wearable, apps, websites) in encouraging physical activity by comparing outcomes between low and high socioeconomic status groups.</p>

<p>It also takes a look at whether the number or kind of behaviour change techniques (BCTS) that are used in these interventions influenced their effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Target group:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lower socioeconomic status populations:</b> Determined by income, level of education, employment, or deprivation indices</li>
<li><b>Higher socioeconomic status populations:</b> Used as a comparison group to evaluate fairness in the effects of the interventions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Average effect size:</h2>

<p>Negligible, non-significant effect in <b>lower socioeconomic status groups</b> (SMD: 0.06, 95% CI: -0.08 to 0.2), small to moderate, statistically significant effect in <b>higher socioeconomic status groups</b> (SMD: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.22 to 0.45)</p>

<h2>Additional results:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Digital interventions possible widening the gap in physical activity, seemingly only possible benefiting individuals of higher socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Low heterogeneity for both groups, implying relatively consistent results across studies</li>
</ul>
</p>
